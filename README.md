# farn
[farn][farn_docs] is an n-dimensional case generator.

Its primary design goal is to parameterize and execute simulation cases.
However, at its core, farn is use-case agnostic and can support a wide spectrum of applications.

The name ‘farn’ is inspired by the [Barnsley fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern)

farn
* runs the sampling of the design space (sampling strategies cover fixed, linSpace, uniformLHS)
* generates the corresponding case folder structure
* copies arbitrary files from a template folder to case folders
* creates case specific parameter files in case folders
* executes user-defined shell command sets in case folders
* builds case specific OSP (co-)simulation files
* runs simulation cases as batch process

## Installation
```sh
pip install farn
```
farn requires the following two (sub-)packages:
1. [dictIO][dictIO_docs]: foundation package, enabling farn to handle configuration files in dictIO dict file format.
2. [ospx][ospx_docs]: extension package, enabling farn to generate OSP (co-)simulation files.

However, both get installed automatically with farn (just pip install farn and you're done).

## Usage Example

farn provides both an API for use inside Python as well as a CLI for shell execution of core functions.

Reading a farnDict file and creating the corresponding case folder structure:
~~~py
from farn import run_farn

run_farn('farnDict', sample=True, generate=True)
~~~

The above task can also be invoked from the command line, using the 'farn' command line script installed with farn:
~~~sh
farn farnDict --sample --generate
~~~

_For more examples and usage, please refer to [farn's documentation][farn_docs] on GitHub Pages._

Further, the [farn-demo][farn_demo_repo] repository on GitHub is an excellent place for a jumpstart into farn.
Simply clone the [farn-demo][farn_demo_repo] repository to your local machine and click through the demos and related READMEs, by recommendation in the following sequence:

    README in root folder -> guides you through installation of farn
    \ospCaseBuilder Demo (see README in ospCaseBuilder folder)
    \farn Demo (see README in farn folder)
    \importSystemStructure  Demo (see README in importSystemStructure folder)


## File Format
A farnDict is a file in dictIO dict file format used with farn.

_For a documentation of the farnDict file format, see [File Format](fileFormat.md) in [farn's documentation][farn_docs] on GitHub Pages._

_For a detailed documentation of the dictIO dict file format used by farn, see [dictIO's documentation][dictIO_docs] on GitHub Pages._

## Development Setup

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher, i.e. [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3912/) or [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/)

2. Update pip and setuptools:

    ~~~sh
    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ~~~

3. git clone the farn repository into your local development directory:

    ~~~sh
    git clone https://github.com/dnv-opensource/farn path/to/your/dev/farn
    ~~~

4. In the farn root folder:

    Create a Python virtual environment:
    ~~~sh
    $ python -m venv .venv
    ~~~
    Activate the virtual environment: <br>
    ..on Windows:
    ~~~sh
    > .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ~~~
    ..on Linux:
    ~~~sh
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    ~~~
    Update pip and setuptools:
    ~~~sh
    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    ~~~
    Install farn's dependencies:
    ~~~sh
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~~~
